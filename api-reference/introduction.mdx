## Welcome to the Redo API

The Redo API provides programmatic access to manage returns, exchanges, refunds, shipments, and invoices for your store. Built on REST principles, our API uses JSON for requests and responses.

**Base URL:** `https://api.getredo.com/v2.2`

**Current Version:** 2.2.1

## Authentication

### API Endpoints

All API endpoints are authenticated using the Bearer authorization scheme with your `REDO_API_SECRET`. You can find your API secret in your Redo dashboard.

Include your API secret in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```http
GET /v2.2/stores/{storeId}/returns HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer 77bb7598b7a972475cc7c7e171ec33af
Host: api.getredo.com
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API secret secure. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

### Webhooks

Webhooks use Bearer authentication with a secret you provide when creating the webhook subscription. Redo will include this secret in the `Authorization` header when delivering webhook events to your endpoint:

```http
POST /events HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer subscriberauth123
Host: subscriber.example.com
```

Webhook events are delivered in order for each individual subject (e.g., return). If your endpoint doesn't respond with a 2xx status code, the event will be retried multiple times before being discarded.

## Response Format

### Success Responses

Successful requests return JSON with a 2xx status code:

```json
{
  "return": {
    "id": "64df65d4c5a4ca3eff4b4e43",
    "status": "pending",
    "createdAt": "2023-08-18T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Error Responses

Errors follow [RFC 7807](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7807) Problem Details format and use the `application/problem+json` content type:

```json
{
  "type": "about:blank",
  "title": "Not Found",
  "detail": "The requested return could not be found",
  "instance": "/returns/invalid-id"
}
```

## Pagination

List endpoints support cursor-based pagination using these query parameters:

- `page-size`: Number of items to return (default varies by endpoint)
- `page-continue`: Cursor token from the previous response

The `X-Page-Next` response header contains the cursor for the next page:

```http
X-Page-Next: eyJjcmVhdGVkQXQiOiIyMDIzLTA4LTE4VDEyOjAwOjAwWiJ9
```

To fetch the next page, pass this value as the `page-continue` parameter.
