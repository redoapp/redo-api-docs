## Integration with Web Components

The coverage products returned by this endpoint correspond to the products that can be added to the cart via the [Shopify Web Components](/guides/shopify-web-components):

```javascript
// When the checkbox is checked, add the coverage product to cart
if (redoCheckbox.value) {
  cart.items.push({
    quantity: 1,
    variantId: redoCheckbox.variantId // This matches variantId from this API
  });
}
```

<Info>
  Coverage products are typically managed through your e-commerce platform (e.g., Shopify) and synchronized with Redo. The `externalId` and `variantId` fields link back to your platform's product catalog.
