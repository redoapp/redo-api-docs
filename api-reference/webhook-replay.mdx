## Overview

The webhook replay endpoint allows you to re-send historical events to your webhook endpoint. This is useful for:

- Testing your webhook endpoint during development
- Recovering from downtime or missed events
- Backfilling data after setting up a new webhook
- Debugging webhook processing issues

## Path Parameters

<ParamField path="webhookId" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier for the webhook subscription
</ParamField>

## Request Body

<ParamField body="startTime" type="string" required>
  ISO 8601 timestamp of the start of the replay period. Events that occurred at or after this time will be replayed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="endTime" type="string" required>
  ISO 8601 timestamp of the end of the replay period. Events that occurred before or at this time will be replayed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="topics" type="array">
  Optional array of specific topics to replay. If not provided, all topics from the webhook subscription will be replayed.
</ParamField>

## Response

<ResponseField name="replayId" type="string">
  Unique identifier for this replay operation
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  Status of the replay operation (e.g., `queued`, `processing`, `completed`)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="eventsQueued" type="integer">
  Number of events queued for replay
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="startTime" type="string">
  Start time of the replay period
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="endTime" type="string">

</ResponseField>

## Example Request

```json
{
  "startTime": "2023-08-01T00:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2023-08-18T23:59:59Z",
  "topics": ["return.created", "return.updated"]
}
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "replayId": "replay_abc123",
  "status": "processing",
  "eventsQueued": 150,
  "startTime": "2023-08-01T00:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2023-08-18T23:59:59Z"
}
```

## Behavior

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Event ordering">
    Replayed events are sent in chronological order, maintaining the same ordering guarantees as live events.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Event type">
    Replayed events include `"type": "backfill"` in the payload to distinguish them from live events.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Rate limiting">
    Replayed events are delivered at a controlled rate to avoid overwhelming your endpoint. Large replays may take some time to complete.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Retry behavior">
    Replayed events follow the same retry logic as live events. If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status code, the event will be retried.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Maximum time range">
    There may be limits on how far back you can replay events. Contact support if you need to replay very old events.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Use a shorter time range (e.g., 1 day) when testing to avoid long-running replay operations.
</Tip>

## Use Cases

### Testing During Development

```bash
# Replay the last day of events to test your new webhook endpoint
curl -X POST "https://api.getredo.com/v2.2/webhooks/webhook_123/replay" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "startTime": "2023-08-17T00:00:00Z",
    "endTime": "2023-08-18T23:59:59Z"
  }'
```

### Recovery from Downtime

```bash
# Replay events missed during a 2-hour outage
curl -X POST "https://api.getredo.com/v2.2/webhooks/webhook_123/replay" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "startTime": "2023-08-18T10:00:00Z",
    "endTime": "2023-08-18T12:00:00Z"
  }'
```

### Backfilling Historical Data

```bash
# Backfill all return.updated events for the past month
curl -X POST "https://api.getredo.com/v2.2/webhooks/webhook_123/replay" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_SECRET" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "startTime": "2023-07-18T00:00:00Z",
    "endTime": "2023-08-18T23:59:59Z",
    "topics": ["return.updated"]
