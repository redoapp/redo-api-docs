## API Endpoints

All API endpoints are authenticated using the Bearer authorization scheme with your `REDO_API_SECRET`.

Include your API secret in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```http
GET /v2.2/stores/{storeId}/returns HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer 77bb7598b7a972475cc7c7e171ec33af
Host: api.getredo.com
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API secret secure. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.getredo.com/v2.2/stores/store_123/returns" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_SECRET"
```

## Webhooks

Webhooks are authenticated using the Bearer authorization scheme with a secret **you provide** when creating the webhook subscription.

Redo will include this secret in the `Authorization` header when delivering webhook events to your endpoint:

```http
POST /events HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer subscriberauth123
Host: subscriber.example.com
```

**Always verify the Authorization header** in your webhook handler before processing events.

### Webhook Event Delivery

- Webhook events are delivered **in order** for each individual subject (e.g., return)
- If the response is not a 2xx status code, the event will be retried multiple times before discarding it

See the [Webhooks guide](/guides/webhooks) for detailed setup instructions.
