## Overview

In addition to its own native API, Redo offers a Loop Returns-compatible API.

This API allows systems to leverage an existing integration with Loop into an integration with Redo, with very little work.

## Documentation

The Loop-compatible API has the same endpoints and data formats as described in Loop's documentation: [https://docs.loopreturns.com/api-reference/getting-started](https://docs.loopreturns.com/api-reference/getting-started)

To use this API with Redo, instead of sending requests to:
```
https://api.loopreturns.com
```

Send requests to:
```
https://loop-api.getredo.com
```

<Note>
  Loop's documentation is sometimes incomplete or does not match actual Loop responses. When docs and Loop's actual behavior differ, Redo follows the actual behavior.
